[webtest.py](https://github.com/z3r0r3za/webtest/blob/main/src/webtest.py) is a python script for testing website application vulnerabilities.

Inspired by Rana Khalil while taking her [Web Security Academy Series](https://academy.ranakhalil.com/courses/) course.

Created while working on the [portswigger web-security](https://portswigger.net/web-security/all-labs) labs.

I'm doing this to learn more about python and to have a better understanding of web application vulnerabilities and other concepts within cyber security.
