# Standalone Scripts

Here are the individual scripts that [webtest.py](https://github.com/z3r0r3za/webtest/blob/main/src/webtest.py) is based on. The functions in each file were copied over and converted into classes to work from within a single script.

Inpired by the [Web Security Academy Series](https://academy.ranakhalil.com/courses/) course that takes you through the [portswigger web-security](https://portswigger.net/web-security/all-labs) labs.
